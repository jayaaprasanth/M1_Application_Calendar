| ID	| Description |	Status (Implemented/Future) |
| -- | ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Automation	| A Calendars can use existing data to make smart suggestions. For example, if you have a monthly team meeting at a local coffee shop, you calendar can automatically suggest exactly when and where that meeting should take place. |	Futute |
| RSVP tracking and forwarding |	Keeping tabs of your events is a key component of time management. But managing who is and isn’t attending can be time consuming. Thankfully most online calendars allow you to track responses and RSVPs.|	Future |
| Natural language processing | 	Artificial intelligence is the development of natural language processing.Calendars like Calendly, Doodle and ScheduleOnce are using using natural language so that you can quickly add and edit events.|	Future |
| Integration with other applications	| That means if you want to make life much easier you’ll want a calendar that integrates with your existing tools. If you used a scheduling app like Calendar then it should definitely sync with popular calendars like Google, Outlook Calendar, Office Calendar or Apple Calendar.| Future
| Multiple time zone support	| As technology continues to advance, and more companies see the benefit of remote workers, expect that figure to increase dramatically.The catch, however, is that with more people working virtually there’s a better chance that you’re working with someone in a different time zone. This way you can plan your event accordingly |	Future |
